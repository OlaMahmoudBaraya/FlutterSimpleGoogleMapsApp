How to get the user current live location in Flutter and open this location in GoogleMaps.

# Flutter Current Location using Google Maps
This Flutter project demonstrates how to integrate Google Maps to display the user's current location on a map.
The app utilizes the `google_maps_flutter` package for map integration and the `geolocator` package to fetch the device's current location.

## Getting Started
You can find the main code at 'lib/main.dart' to run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Flutter and Dart should be installed on your machine.
  
### Features
Display a Google Map centered on the user's current location.
Update the map location as the user moves.

### License
Remember to replace placeholders like `your-username` and `your-project`, with your actual information.
Additionally, create a `screenshots` folder within your project directory to store the app screenshots that you might want to include in the README.
Feel free to customize this template further to match the specifics of your project and its structure.
